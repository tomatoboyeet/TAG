# TAG
wassup the people of the internet

this is tag. the games are made by me.

the concept of tag, is basing it on existing game concepts, and upgrading them.

i hate games that require money to download, or limit u.

SAY NO MORE TO PAYING FOR THE GAME.

i also hate games without builtin commands.

the worse part is, you cant know the source code of games! i hate it. so annoying.

the idea behind tag is changing the world of gaming.

gaming is based on a lot of data, so how about we store all the map data in a txt file, no bigger than 1MB?
